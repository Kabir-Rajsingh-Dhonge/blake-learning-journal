# Day - 6 

i only updated the note on jan 30 As it was my birthday on jan 30 . yeah i am 19 now this is my last year as a teenager . i just don't want to grow old of this phase but this is the law of nature . 

i was looking how i did on my first week it was good ,i learn some interesting thing and two on my first week of learning but enhancing the note using ai seems wrong as this is the journey i should write on my and keep my rawness to this. so from today onwards there will be notes and things i learn will be  written  without any ai intervention . 


## day 6 of learning 

### learn about the markdown 

> so while i was using ai the way it wrote on markdown was so good and clean i also wanted to write it that way so learn about the markdown .

#### what did i learn about the markdown 
    first i learned about the markdown is syntax 
   - '#' one hashtage is heading 1 , the number of hashtage shows the number of heading 
   - for making text italic * or _ on but side  of the text _italic_
   - for making text bold use two ** or __ on both side __bold__
   - for making text both bold and italic *** or __ or combinatio of the __ * on the starting and end of  __*text*__  


    - for  making the list of unorder items use -,* or + follwed by space 
    

   - for making order list use 1. followed by space 

   1. like this 
   3. so what i need here is made a list and remove the 2. and this is 3. even tho it is 3. the output should be 2. 




   for nested list 

   - yohoho
    - this should be a nested list 
    1. this is nested but nested under the unorder 

1. trying to do opposite of it 
  - it should work according to me if this deosn't work i will fix it 


so the other thing what i learn is that github support the  check boxes 
[ ] maybe this is the make to make it 
[x] work done 


To create a table we use | and --- for formation and :---- for left-aligned , :----: for center and -----: for right-aligned items . when you only use --- it is default or left   

| column 1 | center | column 2 |
|----------|:--------:|----------:|
| items | items | items |

--- 

we use --- for horizontal ruler 

#### how to put link , image , inline code and code block on md

- for link just paste the link or '[link name ](here is the link )
- for image '![image text here ]( link here )
- for writing the inline code use 'code' for it 
- for block of code '''python use this , what i does is highlight the code 
- i have use '>' this ealier it is used to write quote
