### day-4

as the plan have changed . i learned about python today only the basic like syntax and variable and all .
i had a python course by geeksforgeeks , so i started and before that i had watch some of the youtube video .
the course also provides the certificate after i complete it .

Things i learn today 

i didn't know the python had types like cpython,jython,pypy and iron python and all .  
the one we generally use is cpython , the jython support java libaries  and the pypy is the fastest one 

python is high level langauge not as c that i learned at highschool  but we can see c as combination of both high and low level langauge .

how does python excutes code 


.py source code
      ↓
Compiler (inside CPython)
      ↓
Bytecode (.pyc)
      ↓
Python Virtual Machine (C loop)
      ↓
CPU


# to print the output 
print() is used to print the output 

# is used for single line comment and 
"""  three semi-colom is used for multi-line comment    """

# to take the input 
input() 

# to delare the variable just just write the words that are not in the key word and we don't need to write if  it is int,float or character  
a = 12 


# so how to we take the input in only in int or in a particular data type 

a = int(input())
     here we delare what kind of datatype we are asking for
