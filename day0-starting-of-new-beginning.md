#day-0 

it has been 2 months since  i had learn how to use githup and its basic command  like pull, commits, push . today is jan 24 revising those topics and being ready as i want to learn in a consistent manner from today and end my habit to Procrastination . i plan to learn 6 days a week .

#revising the git and githup 

Git is a tool or can say it is a software and git is a service . githup uses git but git doesn't need githup .git tracks the change locally and can work offline too where githup is the software where git repo are stored online .

he git is a version controll system . it keeps the track of your old and new version and can go the any version like a time machine which can go any past version .

basic git command 

git init = this create a hidden .git folder. which turns the normal folder into a git project 

git status = which tells What changed ,What’s staged ,What’s not tracked

git add file.c = adding a particular to the staging 

git add . = adding everything changed to the staging 

git commit -m "what changed made is write here " = to commit the change 

to show the commit made in the githup . we should use the command 

git push -u origin main  =which pushes the changes into the githup 


git log =to view the history 



so this are some basic things that i revise today to start my this learning journey form day -1 i will be learning about the foundation of backend how backend works , what is backend and all and its main concept like http and all
