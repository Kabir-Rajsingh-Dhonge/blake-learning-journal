# DAY 7 

> I will not learn anything new . i will revise what i learn and write code in pytyon as i asked Ai to give me question i can do . On the 63 line of day- 6 i did a mistake ' is not used for block of code ` this is used and my nested list doesn't give ouput i expected .

I procrastinated. I revised the previous topic and then started using my phone, scrolling the through content. I ended up falling asleep and woke up late, so I couldn’t code or learn a new topic.
